My all in one "library", made mostly for me with idea that i want reusable peace of my code that i will be able to use in future projects.
It's also ezier to finish components because they are independent of eachother.

Directory "test" is filled with tests i make to check if components of the library works but can be also used as use cases to see how to use them

For now its all in one many topics in one "library" so i'll add interesting materials i found on specific topics, cuz i don't know what else could be added here!
